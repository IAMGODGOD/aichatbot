I was in a major car accident today, I was driving over an overpass and after that, there was a car that turned in front of me, I tried braking but no matter what I tried I was screwed, I T-boned them. We are all alright I believe and I thank God for my survival. My chest hurts a little from the seatbelt and my knee got a bruise somehow, my stomach hurts from the airbag hitting it (I am a fairly big guy) but that is all. Mom's car she passed on to me is now ruined, the other party admitted fault and thankfully they have full insurance. I am without a car for now and that sucks, it hurt more to lose that car, it meant so much to mom. I cried I have to admit that I feel even though it wasn't my fault that I had let her down and ruined her pride and joy of a car. She loved that car and I feel like I have ruined it. I am sorry mom, they say it is not my fault but had I been somewhere else this would not have happened. Rest easy in Heaven knowing God made sure I would not die in that crash and be thankful to him for seeing me through it and allowing me to continue with no injruies. Thank you God, I am sorry Mom, I love you mom
It's just gone 1 am, and I should be in bed getting my much-needed rest after today's workload. But since yesterday's massive overhaul of heavy energy atmospherically compounded all of me and left me drained and waaaaaaaay too emotional and miserable. I realize I was right that it had ALL to do with others and the retrograde ending and highlighted my fed-up with stupid emotional crap.

Emotions are the downfall for moving forward and all the empaths out there; let me give you some advice from the Heyoka. You are doing it ALL wrong! Your purpose is not to overcome others drainage of you. You are not here to guide and support others emotional barriers. You not even supposed to be putting up with it or believing our resilience is your crown. It isn't. Your empathic abilities are for one reason only - To manipulate energy and use that energy to enhance your own life. When you do this, it influences and affects ALL others around you, and it projects a serenity and beams it that draws people to you positively. By that, I mean, whether those people have mental blockages or not, whether they are in difficulties, they absorb the energy you've manipulated into your world, and you do nothing. You don't have to do anything. This energy does the work for you for them. That is all you have to do with your empathy. Not everybody that comes to you is meant to go to you to help. It is only the energy they need, like basking in the sun. You just emit it, and the world turns itself for them. That is how you heal. You're not meant to be emotionally attached to them. Focus on manipulating the energy, and it's so much fun when you do! Especially when remote viewing begins, you can see everywhere and all people when you focus on them.

Now back to what I was saying. Since the lift of retrograde, eclipses and blackouts from the Schumann resonance, our natural world has reset itself as we know it. What lingered, has ended, what didn't serve, is over. And with that, like life, it renews itself and begins again.

Emotions are a barrier to clarity and an obstacle to manifesting. Clear emotions and watch everything change.

Today has been insane. Orders come in for my business, and my day job had an unexpected sale come in from one of my clients that took me to reach 164% OVER my quarterly target. I was already over by 140% until today. I have remained the highest-earning saleswoman in the company, and soon, I reach the five-year mark of working for them and will receive a ridiculous corporate crappy award. LMFAO. I'm not too fond of that b.s.

Also, I have sat behind my phone numerous points throughout the day and evening, receiving RESPECTFUL thought out compliments and romantic offers from the mad scientist, Mr Builder and Ed (the most shocking with things he said after he shagged his wife thinking of me, lol), and Adonis has sent kisses and gentleness and a goodnight, which is unlike Adonis. He's mean and brutal, lol, but I know what he is after.

I'm not chasing any of them, they come to me, and I make decisions as I come and go. Simples.


 have sexual masochist disorder...
Now there is a difference between being a masochist and having the disorder.
A masochist can life their life plainly, get spanked and love it and can be un-expecting. Me however, i suffer from depression because of the lack of pain in my life. The more I’m not being embarrassed, humiliated, physically hurt or in any other way abused, i am feeling worse. The longer i am being abused in some way the happier and mire horny i get.

Sometimes I can’t even watch porn because I get so jealous of the person getting beaten that i start to cry, or get really angry. And regular porn just doesn’t even help me. I know masochism is confusing to a lot of people, they don’t know why you want to be hurt. Doesn’t make sense to me either, but I’m more than just a masochist, I’m disordered. I cannot even function as a human being on a day to day basis only because of my severe depression from nobody abusing me in some way shape or form.

Sometimes people think I’m joking when i say “no safeword necessary”. Well I know I’m wrong, a safeword is ALWAYS necessary. But I’m in just desperation for pain PLUS i want the abuse to feel so genuine. Having a safeword would mean i have a way out but I don’t want the feeling of safety. I want the feeling of abuse at its truest form. Perhaps I could be a dom if i was healthy. But each time I try I only get depressed and jealous of the person that I’m tying up and whipping. I’m jealous of the pain they feel and depressed that I’m not feeling it.

y mom is the reason
One of the reasons I’m going to end it
She makes my life miserable
I’m done
Tired

So like I said in an earlier entry I really don't wanna have sex with anyone and surprisingly the topic came up when we were talking and I told them that I really wasn't comfortable with the idea of us having sex and they took it pretty well! I'm just so happy cause I was so fucking scared at the thought of having sex that I think it's the reason why I felt nauseous for like 4 weeks haha. We've agreed on no sex even tho they did say they were a little bit disappointed but they understood and they would respect my boundaries. I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders and angels are singing lmao. To be clear they didn't do anything wrong to make me not want to have sex with them, I just am working through some issues rn and also I'm very uncomfortable with alot of "normal" human contact. Anyway yeah that's the update, if anyone wants to know more I could probably do another entry about whatever haha. Just be aware I don't check this site very often so it might be a couple days to a week before I do anything. Um anyway thanks for reading ( ◜‿◝ )♡

All code was developed and tested on OSX and Ubuntu 16.04.

## Step 1: Generating Images
First we render synthetic images using [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), outputting both rendered images as well as a JSON file containing ground-truth scene information for each image.

Blender ships with its own installation of Python which is used to execute scripts that interact with Blender; you'll need to add the `image_generation` directory to Python path of Blender's bundled Python. The easiest way to do this is by adding a `.pth` file to the `site-packages` directory of Blender's Python, like this:

```bash
echo $PWD/image_generation >> $BLENDER/$VERSION/python/lib/python3.5/site-packages/clevr.pth
```

where `$BLENDER` is the directory where Blender is installed and `$VERSION` is your Blender version; for example on OSX you might run:

```bash
echo $PWD/image_generation >> /Applications/blender/blender.app/Contents/Resources/2.78/python/lib/python3.5/site-packages/clevr.pth
```

You can then render some images like this:

```bash
cd image_generation
blender --background --python render_images.py -- --num_images 10
```

On OSX the `blender` binary is located inside the blender.app directory; for convenience you may want to
add the following alias to your `~/.bash_profile` file:

```bash
alias blender='/Applications/blender/blender.app/Contents/MacOS/blender'
```

If you have an NVIDIA GPU with CUDA installed then you can use the GPU to accelerate rendering like this:

```bash
blender --background --python render_images.py -- --num_images 10 --use_gpu 1
```

After this command terminates you should have ten freshly rendered images stored in `output/images` like these:

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/img1.png" width="260px">
  <img src="images/img2.png" width="260px">
  <img src="images/img3.png" width="260px">
  <br>
  <img src="images/img4.png" width="260px">
  <img src="images/img5.png" width="260px">
  <img src="images/img6.png" width="260px">
</div>

The file `output/CLEVR_scenes.json` will contain ground-truth scene information for all newly rendered images.

You can find [more details about image rendering here](image_generation/README.md).

## Step 2: Generating Questions
Next we generate questions, functional programs, and answers for the rendered images generated in the previous step.
This step takes as input the single JSON file containing all ground-truth scene information, and outputs a JSON file 
containing questions, answers, and functional programs for the questions in a single JSON file.

You can generate questions like this:

```bash
cd question_generation
python generate_questions.py
```

The file `output/CLEVR_questions.json` will then contain questions for the generated images.

You can [find more details about question generation here](question_generation/README.md).

# CLEVR Image Generation

Images are generated by using Blender to invoke the script `render_images.py` like this:

```
blender --background --python render_images.py -- [args]
```

Any arguments following the `--` will be captured by `render_images.py`.

This command should be run from the `image_generation` directory, since by default the script will load resources from the `data` directory.

When rendering on cluster machines without audio drivers installed you may need to add the `-noaudio` flag to the Blender invocation like this:

```
blender --background -noaudio --python render_images.py -- [args]
```

You can also run `render_images.py` as a standalone script to view help on all command line flags like this:

```
python render_images.py --help
```

## Setup
You will need to download and install [Blender](https://www.blender.org/); code has been developed and tested using Blender version 2.78c but other versions may work as well.

Blender ships with its own version of Python 3.5, and it uses its bundled Python to execute scripts. You'll need to add this directory to the Python path of Blender's bundled Python with a command like this:

```
echo $PWD >> $BLENDER/$VERSION/python/lib/python3.5/site-packages/clevr.pth
```

where `$BLENDER` is the directory where Blender is installed and `$VERSION` is your Blender version; for example on OSX you might run:

```
echo $PWD >> /Applications/blender/blender.app/Contents/Resources/2.78/python/lib/python3.5/site-packages/clevr.pth
```

## Rendering Overview
The file `data/base_scene.blend` contains a Blender scene used for the basis of all CLEVR images. This scene contains a ground plane, a camera, and several light sources. After loading the base scene, the positions of the camera and lights are randomly jittered (controlled with the `--key_light_jitter`, `--fill_light_jitter`, `--back_light_jitter`, and `--camera_jitter` flags).

After the base scene has been loaded, objects are placed one by one into the scene. The number of objects for each scene is a random integer between `--min_objects` (default 3) and `--max_objects` (default 10), and each object has a random shape, size, color, and material.

After placing all objects, we ensure that no objects are fully occluded; in particular each object must occupy at least 100 pixels in the rendered image (customizable using `--min_pixels_per_object`). To accomplish this, we assign each object a unique color and render a version of the scene with lighting and shading disabled, writing it to a temporary file; we can then count the number of pixels of each color in this pre-render to check the number of visible pixels for each object.

Each invocation of `render_images.py` will render `--num_images` images, and they will be numbered starting at `--start_idx` (default 0). Using non-default values for `--start_idx` allows you to distribute rendering across many workers and recombine their results later without filename conflicts.

### Object Placement
Each object is positioned randomly, but before actually adding the object to the scene we ensure that its center is at least `--min_dist` units away from the centers of all other objects. We also ensure that between each pair of objects, the left/right and front/back distance along the ground plane is at least `--margin` units; this helps to minimize ambiguous spatial relationships. If after `--max_retries` attempts we are unable to find a suitable position for an object, then all objects are deleted and placed again from scratch.

### Image Resolution
By default images are rendered at `320x240`, but the resolution can be customized using the `--height` and `--width` flags.

### GPU Acceleration
Rendering uses CPU by default, but if you have an NVIDIA GPU with CUDA installed then you can use the GPU to accelerate rendering by adding the flag `--use_gpu 1`. Blender also supports acceleration using OpenCL which allows the use of non-NVIDIA GPUs; however this is not currently supported by `render_images.py`.

### Rendering Quality
You can control the quality of rendering with the `--render_num_samples` flag; using fewer samples will run more quickly but will result in grainy images. I've found that 64 samples is a good number to use for development; all released CLEVR images were rendered using 512 samples. The `--render_min_bounces` and `--render_max_bounces` control the number of bounces for transparent objects; I've found the default of 8 to work well for these options.

When rendering, Blender breaks up the output image into tiles and renders tiles sequentialy; the `--render_tile_size` flag controls the size of these tiles. This should not affect the output image, but may affect the speed at which it is rendered. For CPU rendering smaller tile sizes may be optimal, while for GPU rendering larger tiles may be faster.

With default settings, rendering a 320x240 image takes about 4 seconds on a Pascal Titan X. It's very likely that these rendering times could be drastically reduced by someone more familiar with Blender, but this rendering speed was acceptable for our purposes.

You can save a Blender `.blend` file for each rendered image by adding the flag `--save_blendfiles 1`. These files can be more than 5 MB each, so they are not saved by default.

### Output Files
Rendered images are stored in the `--output_image_dir` directory, which is created if it does not exist. The filename of each rendered image is constructed from the `--filename_prefix`, the `--split`, and the image index.

A JSON file for each scene containing ground-truth object positions and attributes is saved in the `--output_scene_dir` directory, which is created if it does not exist. After all images are rendered the JSON files for each individual scene are combined into a single JSON file and written to `--output_scene_file`. This single file will also store the `--split`, `--version` (default 1.0), `--license` (default CC-BY 4.0), and `--date` (default today).

When rendering large numbers of images, I have sometimes experienced random Blender crashes; saving JSON files for each scene as they are rendered ensures that you do not lose information for scenes already rendered in the event of a crash.

If saving Blender scene files for each image (`--save_blendfiles 1`) then they are stored in the `--output_blend_dir` directory, which is created if it does not exist.

### Object Properties
The file `--properties_json` file (default `data/properties.json`) defines the allowed shapes, sizes, colors, and materials used for objects, making it easy to extend CLEVR with new object properties.

Each shape (cube, sphere, cylinder) is stored in its own `.blend` file in the `--shape_dir` (default `data/shapes`); the file `X.blend` contains a single object named `X` centered at the origin with unit size. The `shapes` field of the JSON properties file maps human-readable shape names to `.blend` files in the `--shape_dir`.

The `colors` field  of the JSON properties file maps human-readable color names to RGB values between 0 and 255; most of our colors are adapted from [Wad's Optimum 16 Color Palette](http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~wad/color/palette.html).

The `sizes` field of the JSON properties file maps human-readable size names to scaling factors used to scale the object models from the `--shape_dir`.

Each material is stored in its own `.blend` file in the `--material_dir` (default `data/materials`). The file `X.blend` should contain a single NodeTree item named X, and this NodeTree item must have a single `Color` input that accepts an RGBA value so that each material can be used with any color. The `materials` field of the JSON properties file maps human-readable material names to `.blend` files in the `--material_dir`.

### Restricting Shape / Color Combinations
The optional `--shape_color_combos_json` flag can be used to restrict the colors of each shape. If provided, this should give a path to a JSON file mapping shape names to lists of allowed color names. This option can be used to render CLEVR-CoGenT images using the files `data/CoGenT_A.json` and `data/CoGenT_B.json`.

All code was developed and tested on OSX and Ubuntu 16.04.

## Step 1: Generating Images
First we render synthetic images using [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), outputting both rendered images as well as a JSON file containing ground-truth scene information for each image.

Blender ships with its own installation of Python which is used to execute scripts that interact with Blender; you'll need to add the `image_generation` directory to Python path of Blender's bundled Python. The easiest way to do this is by adding a `.pth` file to the `site-packages` directory of Blender's Python, like this:

```bash
echo $PWD/image_generation >> $BLENDER/$VERSION/python/lib/python3.5/site-packages/clevr.pth
```

where `$BLENDER` is the directory where Blender is installed and `$VERSION` is your Blender version; for example on OSX you might run:

```bash
echo $PWD/image_generation >> /Applications/blender/blender.app/Contents/Resources/2.78/python/lib/python3.5/site-packages/clevr.pth
```

You can then render some images like this:

```bash
cd image_generation
blender --background --python render_images.py -- --num_images 10
```

On OSX the `blender` binary is located inside the blender.app directory; for convenience you may want to
add the following alias to your `~/.bash_profile` file:

```bash
alias blender='/Applications/blender/blender.app/Contents/MacOS/blender'
```

If you have an NVIDIA GPU with CUDA installed then you can use the GPU to accelerate rendering like this:

```bash
blender --background --python render_images.py -- --num_images 10 --use_gpu 1
```

After this command terminates you should have ten freshly rendered images stored in `output/images` like these:

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/img1.png" width="260px">
  <img src="images/img2.png" width="260px">
  <img src="images/img3.png" width="260px">
  <br>
  <img src="images/img4.png" width="260px">
  <img src="images/img5.png" width="260px">
  <img src="images/img6.png" width="260px">
</div>

The file `output/CLEVR_scenes.json` will contain ground-truth scene information for all newly rendered images.

You can find [more details about image rendering here](image_generation/README.md).

## Step 2: Generating Questions
Next we generate questions, functional programs, and answers for the rendered images generated in the previous step.
This step takes as input the single JSON file containing all ground-truth scene information, and outputs a JSON file 
containing questions, answers, and functional programs for the questions in a single JSON file.

You can generate questions like this:

```bash
cd question_generation
python generate_questions.py
```

The file `output/CLEVR_questions.json` will then contain questions for the generated images.

You can [find more details about question generation here](question_generation/README.md).

# CLEVR Image Generation

Images are generated by using Blender to invoke the script `render_images.py` like this:

```
blender --background --python render_images.py -- [args]
```

Any arguments following the `--` will be captured by `render_images.py`.

This command should be run from the `image_generation` directory, since by default the script will load resources from the `data` directory.

When rendering on cluster machines without audio drivers installed you may need to add the `-noaudio` flag to the Blender invocation like this:

```
blender --background -noaudio --python render_images.py -- [args]
```

You can also run `render_images.py` as a standalone script to view help on all command line flags like this:

```
python render_images.py --help
```

## Setup
You will need to download and install [Blender](https://www.blender.org/); code has been developed and tested using Blender version 2.78c but other versions may work as well.

Blender ships with its own version of Python 3.5, and it uses its bundled Python to execute scripts. You'll need to add this directory to the Python path of Blender's bundled Python with a command like this:

```
echo $PWD >> $BLENDER/$VERSION/python/lib/python3.5/site-packages/clevr.pth
```

where `$BLENDER` is the directory where Blender is installed and `$VERSION` is your Blender version; for example on OSX you might run:

```
echo $PWD >> /Applications/blender/blender.app/Contents/Resources/2.78/python/lib/python3.5/site-packages/clevr.pth
```

## Rendering Overview
The file `data/base_scene.blend` contains a Blender scene used for the basis of all CLEVR images. This scene contains a ground plane, a camera, and several light sources. After loading the base scene, the positions of the camera and lights are randomly jittered (controlled with the `--key_light_jitter`, `--fill_light_jitter`, `--back_light_jitter`, and `--camera_jitter` flags).

After the base scene has been loaded, objects are placed one by one into the scene. The number of objects for each scene is a random integer between `--min_objects` (default 3) and `--max_objects` (default 10), and each object has a random shape, size, color, and material.

After placing all objects, we ensure that no objects are fully occluded; in particular each object must occupy at least 100 pixels in the rendered image (customizable using `--min_pixels_per_object`). To accomplish this, we assign each object a unique color and render a version of the scene with lighting and shading disabled, writing it to a temporary file; we can then count the number of pixels of each color in this pre-render to check the number of visible pixels for each object.

Each invocation of `render_images.py` will render `--num_images` images, and they will be numbered starting at `--start_idx` (default 0). Using non-default values for `--start_idx` allows you to distribute rendering across many workers and recombine their results later without filename conflicts.

### Object Placement
Each object is positioned randomly, but before actually adding the object to the scene we ensure that its center is at least `--min_dist` units away from the centers of all other objects. We also ensure that between each pair of objects, the left/right and front/back distance along the ground plane is at least `--margin` units; this helps to minimize ambiguous spatial relationships. If after `--max_retries` attempts we are unable to find a suitable position for an object, then all objects are deleted and placed again from scratch.

### Image Resolution
By default images are rendered at `320x240`, but the resolution can be customized using the `--height` and `--width` flags.

### GPU Acceleration
Rendering uses CPU by default, but if you have an NVIDIA GPU with CUDA installed then you can use the GPU to accelerate rendering by adding the flag `--use_gpu 1`. Blender also supports acceleration using OpenCL which allows the use of non-NVIDIA GPUs; however this is not currently supported by `render_images.py`.

### Rendering Quality
You can control the quality of rendering with the `--render_num_samples` flag; using fewer samples will run more quickly but will result in grainy images. I've found that 64 samples is a good number to use for development; all released CLEVR images were rendered using 512 samples. The `--render_min_bounces` and `--render_max_bounces` control the number of bounces for transparent objects; I've found the default of 8 to work well for these options.

When rendering, Blender breaks up the output image into tiles and renders tiles sequentialy; the `--render_tile_size` flag controls the size of these tiles. This should not affect the output image, but may affect the speed at which it is rendered. For CPU rendering smaller tile sizes may be optimal, while for GPU rendering larger tiles may be faster.

With default settings, rendering a 320x240 image takes about 4 seconds on a Pascal Titan X. It's very likely that these rendering times could be drastically reduced by someone more familiar with Blender, but this rendering speed was acceptable for our purposes.

### Saving Blender Scene Files
You can save a Blender `.blend` file for each rendered image by adding the flag `--save_blendfiles 1`. These files can be more than 5 MB each, so they are not saved by default.

### Output Files
Rendered images are stored in the `--output_image_dir` directory, which is created if it does not exist. The filename of each rendered image is constructed from the `--filename_prefix`, the `--split`, and the image index.

A JSON file for each scene containing ground-truth object positions and attributes is saved in the `--output_scene_dir` directory, which is created if it does not exist. After all images are rendered the JSON files for each individual scene are combined into a single JSON file and written to `--output_scene_file`. This single file will also store the `--split`, `--version` (default 1.0), `--license` (default CC-BY 4.0), and `--date` (default today).

When rendering large numbers of images, I have sometimes experienced random Blender crashes; saving JSON files for each scene as they are rendered ensures that you do not lose information for scenes already rendered in the event of a crash.

If saving Blender scene files for each image (`--save_blendfiles 1`) then they are stored in the `--output_blend_dir` directory, which is created if it does not exist.

### Object Properties
The file `--properties_json` file (default `data/properties.json`) defines the allowed shapes, sizes, colors, and materials used for objects, making it easy to extend CLEVR with new object properties.

Each shape (cube, sphere, cylinder) is stored in its own `.blend` file in the `--shape_dir` (default `data/shapes`); the file `X.blend` contains a single object named `X` centered at the origin with unit size. The `shapes` field of the JSON properties file maps human-readable shape names to `.blend` files in the `--shape_dir`.

The `colors` field  of the JSON properties file maps human-readable color names to RGB values between 0 and 255; most of our colors are adapted from [Wad's Optimum 16 Color Palette](http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~wad/color/palette.html).

The `sizes` field of the JSON properties file maps human-readable size names to scaling factors used to scale the object models from the `--shape_dir`.

Each material is stored in its own `.blend` file in the `--material_dir` (default `data/materials`). The file `X.blend` should contain a single NodeTree item named X, and this NodeTree item must have a single `Color` input that accepts an RGBA value so that each material can be used with any color. The `materials` field of the JSON properties file maps human-readable material names to `.blend` files in the `--material_dir`.

### Restricting Shape / Color Combinations
The optional `--shape_color_combos_json` flag can be used to restrict the colors of each shape. If provided, this should give a path to a JSON file mapping shape names to lists of allowed color names. This option can be used to render CLEVR-CoGenT images using the files `data/CoGenT_A.json` and `data/CoGenT_B.json`.

I'm back again ugh. This is so unnecessary and silly for me to be this upset for so long over something so minor. But I don't really know how else to cope with it other than getting all my thoughts out lol. I went to the store with my family and still have quite a bit of work to do, but I'm caught in the obsessive thinking trap again and I still can't get the heavy feeling to go away. I made dinner plans with one of the girls and she mentioned that she's going out of town next weekend plus it's one of our friend's bdays this week so I feel like the next 2 weeks are just going to be me having FOMO. That's one of the things I really liked about the COVID lockdown was that FOMO didn't exist! Now, I feel like it's worse than ever since things are going back to "normal". I'm almost tempted to get rid of all social media? Or just make a new account only following like celebrities or something just for when I'm bored but it won't make me feel like garbage.
This is really comparable to how I felt after my breakup which is crazy. I feel like this is SO silly to be this upset over!!! This isn't the first time something like this has happened, like the other times where I noticed I wasn't invited to something I was kind of like "great :/" and that was that. I didn't really hold onto that thought for very long.
I'm trying to think of it as: they are all part of each others' primary friend group. I wouldn't really consider them a primary friend group of mine, I guess. So it's nothing personal, it's not like they don't consider me a friend or don't care about me. I just don't know how to spin it and not apply my expectations to them?
To make matters even better, during my meeting, my boss was at a work get-together! We live in the same town and he talked about meeting up to work with me and some others a few weeks ago. I never heard anything about it again after that.. I'm not sure if it was just for like the management to meet up or what, but I was like damn you too?? No one wants me around! Just kidding. But it was kinda like umm.., lol.
These past few months were so peaceful, I felt awesome being alone and being my 'own best friend' in a way. I literally felt like everything was aligned! I shouldn't let a few days of feeling down like detract (is that the right word) from my progress or whatever, but it's hard not to feel like everything I worked towards learning has been thrown out the window. It's crazy how one small inconvenience gets me to feel this down. I feel like I get more and more sensitive every day and I'm SICK of it!!
All I want to do is watch some TV and never look at my phone again, but I'm addicted to it and I have so much left to do for the day. Uuuuuugggggghhhhhhh

 look out my window tonight
And stare at that beautiful moon
That moon that used to make me feel something
And when I look I’m reaching
To find that feeling again, to take it in my hands and hold it in my heart
But the feeling doesn’t come
